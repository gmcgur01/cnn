## Convolutional Neural Network Implementation using CUDA

The following is the code I wrote to implmenent a forward pass of a convolutional neural network using CUDA. It is meant to be executed on an Nvidia GPU. The primary device function can be found in **cnn_user.cu**. In a forward pass of a CNN, we are given an input matrix (i.e. the result from the previous layer) and we must create the output matrix by moving a smaller filter matrix across the input matrix, and performing a series of weighted multiply accumulates for each element in the input matrix and it's corresponding weight in the filter matrix. This tasks presents some difficulties as it's not readily apparent how to split sections of the input matrix into thread blocks, and there's plenty of edge cases that need to be considered. To learn more about my approach, feel free to check out the writeup in **report.pdf**.
